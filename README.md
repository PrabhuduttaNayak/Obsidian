Iâ€™ve created a set of notes on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) that will serve as a concise and practical resource for revising concepts. Keeping these notes in digital format allows for faster access and easier organization through tags and the powerful search features in Obsidian.

For images referenced in the markdown files on GitHub but not embedded directly, you can find them in this Google Drive folder: [Link to Drive.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_z3PhqVZmwTdE6l2Ek6IFT1cIsmOWQxa?usp=drive_link)

To use these notes effectively:
1:Download the contents of the "Professional" folder from the linked Drive.
2:Set it up as a vault in the Obsidian app for seamless navigation and searching.
